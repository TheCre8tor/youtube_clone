## What i Learned
* I gained more experience on how to use CSS Float & Auto Margin.
* How to use Video, Audio & iFrame element in HTML Document.
* My CSS skill improved much more
* and how to structure my HTML Document properly.

## I was able to build this website with only:
* Float
* Auto Margin
* & Overflow

## Remaining Issues
I won't come back to this for a bit but if I did, here are the things I'd like to improve:
* Make the website Responsive to different screen size
* Update the formatting to change when viewport size changes
* Add in remaining missing functionality- dropdown menus and the like
* Use the proper HTML 5 Semantic Element
